This error occurs because the Jupyter notebook is trying to authenticate with the Kubeflow Pipelines server. Let's modify the client connection to handle authentication:

Try this approach in sequence (each in a separate cell):

Cell 1 - First attempt with namespace cookies:
```python
client = kfp.Client(
    host='http://ml-pipeline.kubeflow.svc.cluster.local:8888',
    namespace='kubeflow'
)
```

If that doesn't work, try Cell 2 - Using the internal service DNS:
```python
KUBEFLOW_ENDPOINT = "http://ml-pipeline.kubeflow.svc.cluster.local:8888"
client = kfp.Client(host=KUBEFLOW_ENDPOINT)
```

If still getting errors, try Cell 3 - Disable SSL verification:
```python
client = kfp.Client(
    host='http://ml-pipeline.kubeflow.svc.cluster.local:8888',
    verify=False
)
```


```python
# Test the connection
try:
    experiments = client.list_experiments()
    print("Connection successful!")
    print(f"Found {len(experiments.experiments)} experiments")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Connection failed: {str(e)}")
```


1. Check your current namespace:
```python
!kubectl config view --minify -o jsonpath='{..namespace}'
```

2. Verify the ml-pipeline service is running:
```python
!kubectl get svc -n kubeflow | grep ml-pipeline
```
